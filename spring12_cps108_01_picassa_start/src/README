Students who I discuss with:

Mr.SHI Jiawei
Mr.ZHU Chenbo

I discussed with Mr.SHI about the frame of the program and general thoughts of this assignment.
I discussed with Mr.ZHU about how to deal with the "x y" operation and he suggested to add a 
new "EXPRESSION_XY_REGEX". Other parts of the assignment is totally finished by me alone.

Online resources I used while doing my assignment:
1)http://www.java2s.com/CN/Tutorial/Java/0120__Development/FindsquarerootofanumberusingMathsqrt.htm
2)http://www.java-tips.org/java-se-tips/java.lang/what-is-a-java-subclass.html
3)http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/java/tutorial/java/javaOO/subclass.html

I had some problem starting with square-root and subclass so I checked these information via internet.

Thoughts about this assignment:


I start this course after last semester's CS100 and I had to say that Michael has a different assignment style 
than Ola. Little hints were provided about this assignment at first and I was quite stuck at how to start. But with 
the help Michael offered on Piazza the assignment became pretty clear and easy. Though I still got some problem 
on how to solve the xy operation. I tried to make the code 'flexible' but chances exist that I need further improvement.
